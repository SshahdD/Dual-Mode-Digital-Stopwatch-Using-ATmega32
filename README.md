This project implements a digital stopwatch using the ATmega32 microcontroller, featuring two operational modes: Increment Mode and Countdown Mode. The stopwatch displays time on six multiplexed seven-segment displays and includes user-friendly controls for resetting, pausing, resuming, and adjusting time settings.
